## 💳 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Folder:** `CreditCard_Fraud_Detection`  

### 🔍 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting **fraudulent credit card transactions** using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset is highly imbalanced, making traditional accuracy-based evaluation ineffective.

### 🎯 Objective
- Identify fraudulent transactions with high recall  
- Handle extreme class imbalance using SMOTE  
- Optimize probability thresholds based on **business cost**  

### 🧠 Key Concepts & Techniques
- Stratified Train-Test Split  
- Feature Scaling (Time & Amount)  
- Logistic Regression (Baseline)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- SMOTE (Imbalanced-learn)  
- Threshold Optimization  
- ROC-AUC & Precision-Recall Analysis  

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.9+  
- Google Colab  
- Scikit-learn  
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📈 2. Sales Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

**Folder:** `Sales_Prediction`  

### 🔍 Project Overview
This project builds a **Multiple Linear Regression model** to predict sales based on advertising spend across different marketing channels.

### 🎯 Objective
- Predict sales based on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising spend  
- Help businesses optimize marketing budget allocation  

### 📊 Features Used
- TV Advertising Spend  
- Radio Advertising Spend  
- Newspaper Advertising Spend  

### 📐 Model Evaluation
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score

## 🚢 3. Titanic Survival Prediction

**Folder:** `Titanic_Prediction_Project`  

### 🔍 Project Overview
A classic machine learning classification project to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using historical passenger data.

### 📊 Dataset Details
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset  
- Total Records: 891 passengers  

### 🎯 Objective
- Predict passenger survival based on demographic and travel features  
- Build an interpretable and deployable ML model  

### 🚀 Deployment
The project has been **deployed using Streamlit** for interactive prediction.
